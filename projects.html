		<h2>School Projects</h2>
		<p>
			This is a list of the projects I made for middle school
			<ul>
				<li><a href="the-jungle">The Jungle</a>, for 8th Grade Humanities, is a game where you can act out being in the book <i>The Jungle</i>, by Upton Sinclair. The book is a depressing piece of investigative journalism about a family that immigrates to America in the 1890s and settles in Chicago, and the game is one of the first ones that I put <a href="https://github.com/vityavv/the-jungle">on GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/editingtool.html">Editing Tool</a>, for 8th Grade Media Literacy, is a tool that will highlight overused words. It was a pain to make but ultimately it came out okay</li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/pic2017.html">Prison Industrial Complex</a>, for 7th Grade Humanities, is a website, an animation, and a song, created with my partner Kaylin Li as a project to detail the Prison Industrial Complex that we were learning about</li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/tungsten.html">Tungsten Product Page</a>, for 7th Grade Science, is a not-so-pretty product page for the element Tungsten (W).</li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/news.html">CNN Student News Search Engine</a>, for 6th Grade Science, is a tool that searches headlines from the CNN Student News programs of that year and a showcase of my naivete, as I manually copied each headline, made some disgusting design decisions, and made some atrocious code mistakes in it.</li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/AstronomyQuiz.html">Astronomy Quiz</a>, for 6th Grade Science, is a vocabulary quiz using definitions and terms from our Astronomy unit.</li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/erlhumtim.html">Early Humans Timeline</a>, for 6th Grade Humanities, is a timeline of tools used throughout prehistory.</li>
				<li><a href="schoolsites/respectyourmaterials.html">Respect Your Materials</a>, for 5th Grade "Community Service," is a set of animations and a website for god knows what at this point. I'm only putting it here for the sake of history. Warning: it will burn your eyes.</li>
