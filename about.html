		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>My name is Victor Veytsman. I am a fourteen-year-old living in Brooklyn, New York, and going to Stuyvesant High School. I like programming with Go and JavaScript, and using those to create full stack web applications. I use the openSUSE distro of Linux with the Vim editor. Aside from using computers, I like skiing and playing the flute.</p>
		<p>I am currently in the Stuyvesant Student Union IT department and the Stuyvesant Freshman Caucus IT department. I also do Model UN at school.</p>
